=====================================

ifupdown. It understands interface dependency relationships, simplifies
interface configuration, extends ifquery to support interface config
validation, supports JSON and more.

ifupdown2 comprises of two packages: ifupdown2 and ifupdown2-addons.

The ifupdown2 package provides the required infrastructure to parse, schedule
and manage interface configuration.

The ifupdown2-addons package provides python addon modules to extend ifupdown2
functionality. The default python addon modules include the bridge, vlan, bond,
mstp, address modules and more.
