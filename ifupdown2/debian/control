Description: ifupdown2 is a network interface management tool similar to ifupdown. ifupdown2 is essentially ifupdown re-written in python. ifupdown2 replaces ifupdown and provides the same binaries and files as ifupdown for interface configuration. Like ifupdown, ifupdown2 is a high level tool to configure (or, respectively deconfigure) network interfaces based on interface definitions in the file /etc/network/interfaces. ifupdown2 comes with a new command ifreload and new features with new command line options to existing commands ifup/ifdown/ifquery. New command line options to ifquery can help with querying and validating running state of interfaces.  ifupdown2 supports interface templates for large scale interface deployments with python-mako. mako templates can be included or sourced into /etc/network/interfaces file.  See /usr/share/doc/ifupdown2/README.rst for details about ifupdown2. see examples under /usr/share/doc/ifupdown2/examples.
