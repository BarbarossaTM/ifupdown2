==================

getting started
---------------
Unlike original ifupdown, all interface configuration is moved to external
python modules. That includes inet, inet6 and dhcp configurations.

* if you are looking at fixing bugs or adding new features to the ifupdown2
  infrastructure package, pls look at the apiref, documentation and code
  for python-ifupdown2

* if you are looking at developing a new module, pls look at writing a addon
  module in the python-ifupdown2-addons documentation
